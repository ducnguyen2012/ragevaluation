Cell structures work together to maintain cell survival. Mitochondria produce energy, ribosomes synthesize proteins, and the endoplasmic reticulum transports these molecules. Chloroplasts enable photosynthesis in plant cells, while vacuoles store nutrients. This collaboration sustains vital functions within the cell.
The cell membrane, also called the cell surface membrane, surrounds the cytoplasm of the plant cell and controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. It is partially permeable, allowing selective substances to pass through.
Ribosomes synthesize proteins in the cell. Those attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum make proteins for export, while free ribosomes in the cytoplasm produce proteins used within the cell. The RER transports these proteins to the Golgi body for secretion.
A plant cell has a cell wall, large central vacuole, and chloroplasts, which are absent in animal cells. In contrast, animal cells have smaller vacuoles, no cell wall, and lack chloroplasts, focusing on different structural and functional roles.
Two differences between plant and animal cells visible under a light microscope are that plant cells have a cell wall, which gives them a rigid structure, and they also contain chloroplasts, which are absent in animal cells.
Specialized cells are adapted to their functions by having unique structures that enhance their efficiency. For instance, red blood cells lack a nucleus to transport more oxygen, and muscle cells contain many mitochondria to meet high energy demands for contraction.
Scientists can use stem cells in the future to potentially treat diseases by developing specialized cells that replace damaged or diseased tissues, such as nerve, muscle, or blood cells, offering hope for curing previously untreatable conditions like cancer or organ failure.
Red blood cells are adapted to transport oxygen with their biconcave shape, allowing faster diffusion, and the absence of a nucleus, which provides more space for haemoglobin. Root hair cells have elongated structures, increasing surface area for water and nutrient absorption.
The Golgi body is essential in a cell's function as it modifies, stores, and packages substances made by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into vesicles for secretion. It ensures proteins and lipids are processed and transported efficiently outside the cell.
Diffusion is the movement of particles from a higher concentration to a lower concentration. It aids nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans by facilitating the absorption of nutrients and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide across cell membranes.
The rate of diffusion in living organisms is influenced by factors such as the concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. A steeper concentration gradient, shorter diffusion distance, and larger surface area enhance the efficiency of diffusion processes.
Cells are typically small to maintain an efficient surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for effective nutrient uptake and waste elimination. Large organisms consist of many small cells, facilitating specialization and division of labor, which enhances overall functionality and adaptability.
Root hair cells are adapted for efficient absorption of water and mineral salts through their long, narrow shape, which increases the surface area-to-volume ratio, enhancing uptake. Their large surface area facilitates greater interaction with the soil, optimizing nutrient absorption.
The purpose of the second experimental setup, with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and boiling tube, is to demonstrate that osmosis requires a water potential gradient. This setup illustrates the movement of water molecules, confirming osmosis does not occur without a gradient.
NEWater is crucial for Singapore as it provides up to 40% of the nationâ€™s water supply through advanced recycling of treated wastewater, utilizing reverse osmosis to produce ultra-clean water, thus enhancing water security in a resource-limited environment.
Turgor pressure is crucial for plants as it maintains the firmness and shape of soft tissues. When plant cells are turgid, water-filled vacuoles exert pressure against the cell wall, supporting the plant's structure and preventing wilting during water loss.
To demonstrate osmosis in living tissues using potato strips, place strips in varying sucrose solutions. Measure changes in length; a decrease indicates water loss to the hypertonic solution, showcasing osmosis as water moves from high to low water potential through the potato cell membranes.
Active transport is vital for living cells as it enables the movement of substances against their concentration gradients, using energy from respiration. This process is essential for nutrient uptake, such as glucose in the small intestine and mineral salts in root cells.
Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to one of lower water potential. Unlike diffusion, which involves the movement of solute particles, osmosis specifically concerns water.
Marathon runners consume carbohydrates, including sugary foods, to replenish glycogen stores, providing essential energy for prolonged endurance during races. While excessive sugar can lead to obesity, the controlled intake before a race fuels optimal performance and enhances stamina.
