These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:• the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and• the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.

This process of development is called differentiation. | 2 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect | 14 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.23 Three students are giving their views on cells.

ABCPlant Tissue Culture ScientistPlant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagationof forest trees.How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?Cool Career Figure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish Word AlertPropagation:growing and planting new trees 15 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 TechConnectWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

What is the function of the cell membrane in a plant cell?, The function of the cell membrane in a plant cell is to control the movement of substances in and out of the cell and to maintain the cell's shape and structure.,"4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life. Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide. | 18 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Section A: Multiple-choice Questions1 Which of the cell organelles is notvisible under the ordinary light microscope?Acellulose cell wallBcellulose cell wall and nucleus Cchloroplasts DGolgi body and rough endoplasmic reticulum2 Figure 1.26 shows a typical plant cell.

Each potato needs to be cut into four pieces.Each potato also needs to be soaked in water before cooking.Chefs Nurul and Faridah took a potato each and scraped off its skin.Chef Nurul cut the potato into four pieces before soaking it in water for one hour. Chef Faridah soaked the potato in water for one hour before cutting it into four pieces.Which chef will need to exert more strength to cut the potatoes? Why do you think so? What role does the potato skin play?19 What You Will Learn• What is diffusion?• What is osmosis?• What is active transport? | 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Mitochondria Mitochondria(singular: mitochondrion) are small oval or sausage-shaped organelles (Figure 1.14). Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substances are broken down to release energy (see Chapter 7). This energy may be used by the cell to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction.  9 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.16 Chloroplast(a)Three-dimensional diagram of a chloroplastCompare the general structure of the plant cell (Figure 1.15(a)) with that of the animal cell (Figure 1.15(b)).

(Greek: endoplasm= within the cytoplasm; reticulum= network).• Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).• The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane.

There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood (Figure 1.19) and xylem (Figure 1.20). An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.An organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division.

Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1).

ABCPlant Tissue Culture ScientistPlant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagationof forest trees.How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?Cool Career Figure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish Word AlertPropagation:growing and planting new trees 15 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 TechConnectWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect","Specialized cells are adapted to their functions by having unique structures that enhance their efficiency.

Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers.

Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Why is the Golgi body important in a cell's function?, The Golgi body is important in a cell's function because it chemically modifies and packages substances made by the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion out of the cell. It is not visible under the light microscope and can only be studied under the electron microscope.,"6 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Rough Endoplasmic ReticulumRough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)consists of a network of flattened spaces lined with a membrane (Figure 1.9). (Greek: endoplasm= within the cytoplasm; reticulum= network).• Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).• The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane. Figure 1.9 Three-dimensional diagram of endoplasmic reticulum membrane lined with ribosomes Figure 1.10 Colourised electron micrograph of membrane lined with ribosomes Figure 1.7 Diagram showing parts of the nucleus (three-dimensional reconstruction of images seen under an electron microscope)To see the individual parts of the nucleus clearly, we will need to use an electron microscope (Figure 1.7).  Chromosomes• Each chromosome is a longthread-like structure found within the nucleus. (A human cell contains46 chromosomes.)• It is made up of proteins and a compound called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Hereditary information is stored in DNA. DNA carries instructions that a cell needs for carrying out its activities. • When the cell is dividing, the chromosomes condense and shorten to become thick, rod-shaped structures.Nuclear membraneseparates the contents of the nucleus from the rest of the cytoplasm. Figure 1.8 shows the appearance of chromosomes during cell division.chromosomesFigure 1.8 Highly magnified (25 000x) and colourised electron micrograph of chromosomes during cell division 7 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.11 Colourised electron micrograph of SER  Figure 1.12 Golgi bodyRibosomesRibosomesare small round structures. They are either attached to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or lie freely in the cytoplasm (Figure 1.6 on page 5). They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell.• The ribosomes attached to the RER make proteins that are usually transported out of the cell.• The ribosomes lying freely in the cytoplasm make proteins that are used within the cytoplasm of that cell. The RER transports proteins made by ribosomes to the Golgi body for secretion out of the cell. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)does not have ribosomes attached to its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER (see Figure 1.11). It is connected to the RER. The SER:• synthesises substances such as fats and steroids(sex hormones in mammals are steroids)• converts harmful substances into harmless substances through a process known as detoxificationGolgi body The Golgi body(also known as Golgi apparatus) is shaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattened spaces surrounded by membranes. Vesicles(tiny spherical spaces enclosed by a membrane) can be seen fusing with one side of the Golgi body and pinching off from the opposite side (Figure 1.12).The Golgi body:• chemically modifies substances made by the ER• stores and packages these substances in vesicles for secretion out of the cell (b)Three-dimensional view of Golgi bodytubule of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (a) Colourised electron micrograph of Golgi body (6 250×)flat spacemembrane What role do fats play in your body?

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.","The Golgi body is essential in a cell's function as it modifies, stores, and packages substances made by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into vesicles for secretion. It ensures proteins and lipids are processed and transported efficiently outside the cell.

What is diffusion and how does it help plants and humans with nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange?," Diffusion is the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient. It helps with nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans by allowing for the movement of substances from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration, thus facilitating the exchange of gases and absorption of nutrients.","20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net movement. AimTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in waterProcedure1Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4. Cover the jar and allow it to stand for a few days.2Observe the changes in the colour of the water.  Let’s Investigate 2.1 Figure 2.4 Experimental set-up to demonstrate diffusion | 22 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Diffusion Across a MembraneFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 7.How do plants carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 12. Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate. | 34 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Practical WorkbookExperiment 2C Link Practical WorkbookExperiment 2D Link How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)? A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.","The rate of diffusion in living organisms is influenced by factors such as the concentration gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area-to-volume ratio. A steeper concentration gradient, shorter diffusion distance, and larger surface area enhance the efficiency of diffusion processes.

Why are cells typically small and why do all large organisms have bodies made up of many small cells instead of just one large cell?," Cells are typically small to increase efficiency and ensure survival, and all large organisms have bodies made up of many small cells because of the division of labor and differentiation of cells for specific functions.","2 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect | 14 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.23 Three students are giving their views on cells.

This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)). How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)? Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook. If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips?

Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Let’s Review  Figure 2.32Figure 2.34 Figure 2.33 | 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?

Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.","The purpose of the second experimental setup, with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and boiling tube, is to demonstrate that osmosis requires a water potential gradient. This setup illustrates the movement of water molecules, confirming osmosis does not occur without a gradient.

The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

This may include sugary foods. We know that eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity, sometimes even for people who exercise regularly. Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?40  41Biological MoleculesChapter 3 The Need for Food and WaterAll living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution). Figure 3.1 Food rich in carbohydrates Carbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates (Figure 3.2).  Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates SugarsComplexcarbohydrates:• starch• cellulose• glycogenSingle sugars:• glucose• fructoseDouble sugars:• maltose• sucrose Carbohydrates Helpful Note Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions. | 42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 2. 43 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Link What are enzymes? Read more about them in Chapter 4. Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructoseDouble Sugars A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together.Common double sugars are maltoseand sucrose. Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules. A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.glucose + fructose sucrose The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown inFigure 3.5.A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.

Why is turgor important in plants and how does it help maintain the shape of soft tissues?," Turgor is important in plants because it helps maintain the shape of soft tissues by exerting pressure against the cell walls. This pressure keeps the cells firm and prevents wilting, allowing for essential functions such as photosynthesis.","32 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22). Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential. Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2 placed in a solution of lower water potential As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential. 4 The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp. 3 When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole 33 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata Figure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall.

Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Why is active transport an important process in living cells?, Active transport is important in order for living cells to maintain proper balance and functioning.,"36 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.30 Difference between active transport and diffusion Active transportis the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.EnergyEnergy is required during active transport to ensure that substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes.Disciplinary Idea 2.3 What Is Active Transport?Learning Outcome• Define active transportand discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process by which substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi. Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar.

What processes are involved?Let’s Practise 2.2 Theory WorkbookWorksheet 2B Link Figure 2.29 37 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Where Does Active Transport Occur?Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

Read Chapter 12 to answer the question. Mineral salts can enter the root hair cell, against the concentration gradient Table 2.3 summarises the key differences between diffusion and active transport. Table 2.3 Differences between diffusion and active transport Figure 2.31 Root hair cells take in dissolved mineral salts through diffusion as well as active transport. 1Why does active transport nottake place in dead cells?2Name threecharacteristics that are different between diffusion and active transport. Let’s Practise 2.3 Theory WorkbookWorksheet 2CLet’s AssessLet’s Reflect Link | 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9. | 26 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusionsor folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell.You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

What is osmosis and how does it differ from diffusion?, Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential through a partially permeable membrane. It differs from diffusion in that it specifically refers to the movement of water molecules and involves a selectively permeable membrane.,"22 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Diffusion Across a MembraneFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 7.How do plants carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 12. Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate. | 20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net movement. AimTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in waterProcedure1Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4. Cover the jar and allow it to stand for a few days.2Observe the changes in the colour of the water.  Let’s Investigate 2.1 Figure 2.4 Experimental set-up to demonstrate diffusion | 28 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 ChemistryWe learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)). How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)? Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure 2.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook. If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?

Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?40  41Biological MoleculesChapter 3 The Need for Food and WaterAll living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution). Figure 3.1 Food rich in carbohydrates Carbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates (Figure 3.2).  Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates SugarsComplexcarbohydrates:• starch• cellulose• glycogenSingle sugars:• glucose• fructoseDouble sugars:• maltose• sucrose Carbohydrates Helpful Note Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions. | 42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 2. 43 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Link What are enzymes? Read more about them in Chapter 4. Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructoseDouble Sugars A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together.Common double sugars are maltoseand sucrose. Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules. A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.glucose + fructose sucrose The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown inFigure 3.5.A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.  Figure 3.5 Structure of sucrose | 46 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose Plants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch. In animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen is sometimes called ‘animal starch’. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).  Figure 3.12 Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose Figure 3.13 Digestion of starch Glycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because: • They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential in the cells. • They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, so they will not be lost from the cell. • They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, for example, in tissue respiration. • Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule. Breakdown of StarchStarch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).  Link How is starch broken down in the gut? Read about it in Chapter 5.

Carbohydrates are needed:• as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities; • to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants; • to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acids and fats; • for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA; • to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein; and • to synthesise the nectar in some flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that plants produce to attract insects. How Can We Test for Starch?Starch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops of iodine solutionto any substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.Link What is respiration? How are carbohydrates involved in the formation of DNA?

They help their clients to incorporate healthy eating behaviours into their lifestyle.
